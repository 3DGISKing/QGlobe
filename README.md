QGlobe renders the entire globe with tiled image, terrain, vector and 3D mesh.
QGlobe has the ability to open, edit and render KML.
It has simple measurement functions.
It has the tour, flying function similar to Google Earth.
QGlobe ’s rendering engine is the OpenGL version of the Irrlicht Engine.
It ‘s UI is made of Qt.
It can be run as standalone or C/S.
The standalone version reads directly all necessary data for rendering from the configured path and in the client version all data is streamed from the server . 

In QGlobe all image, terrain, vector and 3d data are served through preprocessed tiled, so called “block” files. Each “block” file contains 128 * 128 tile and it is designed to quickly find the tile by tile identifier.
