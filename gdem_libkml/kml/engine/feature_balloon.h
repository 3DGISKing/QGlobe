// This file contains the declaration of the CreateBalloonText function.

// Every KML Feature may have an associated "description balloon". By default,
// this is an HTML composition of the Feature's name and description. It may
// be overridden with the use of BalloonStyle, and may further be modified
// by the use of entity replacements (such as "$[name]") and by supplying
// various combinations of ExtendedData elements.
// A useful guide for the various combinations of the latter can be found here:
// http://code.google.com/apis/kml/documentation/extendeddata.html
// For more information, see the OGC KML 2.2 specificication. In particular,
// sections 6.5 and 9.1.3.10.
