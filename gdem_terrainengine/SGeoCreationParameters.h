		/** If this is set to a value other than 0, the Geo Engine
		will be created in an already existing window. For windows, set
		this to the HWND of the window you want. The windowSize and
		FullScreen options will be ignored when using the WindowId
		parameter. Default this is set to 0.
		To make Geo run inside the custom window, you still will
		have to draw Geo on your own. You can use this loop, as
		usual:
		\code
		while (device->run())
		{
			driver->beginScene(true, true, 0);
			smgr->drawAll();
			driver->endScene();
		}
		\endcode
		Instead of this, you can also simply use your own message loop
		using GetMessage, DispatchMessage and whatever. Calling
		GeoDevice::run() will cause Geo to dispatch messages
		internally too.  You need not call Device->run() if you want to
		do your own message dispatching loop, but Geo will not be
		able to fetch user input then and you have to do it on your own
		using the window messages, DirectInput, or whatever. Also,
		you'll have to increment the Geo timer.
		An alternative, own message dispatching loop without
		device->run() would look like this:
		\code
		MSG msg;
		while (true)
		{
			if (PeekMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE))
			{
				TranslateMessage(&msg);
				DispatchMessage(&msg);

				if (msg.message == WM_QUIT)
					break;
			}

			// increase virtual timer time
			device->getTimer()->tick();

			// draw engine picture
			driver->beginScene(true, true, 0);
			smgr->drawAll();
			driver->endScene();
		}
		\endcode
		However, there is no need to draw the picture this often. Just
		do it how you like. */

		//! Don't use or change this parameter.
		/** Always set it to GEOENGINE_SDK_VERSION, which is done by default.
