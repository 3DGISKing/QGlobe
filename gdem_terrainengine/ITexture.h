//! Interface of a Video Driver dependent Texture.
/**
	An ITexture is created by an IVideoDriver by using IVideoDriver::addTexture or
	IVideoDriver::getTexture. After that, the texture may only be used by this VideoDriver.
	As you can imagine, textures of the DirectX and the OpenGL device will, e.g., not be compatible.
	An exception is the Software device and the NULL device, their textures are compatible.
	If you try to use a texture created by one device with an other device, the device
	will refuse to do that and write a warning or an error message to the output buffer.
